C-Minus
=======

A project comes from the book [Compiler Construction](http://www.cs.sjsu.edu/~louden/cmptext/).

C- is a subset of C. It contains integers, integer arrays, and functions. It has local and global declarations. It has an if-statement and a while-statement, as well as supports recursive functions. It lacks almost everything else. More detail in Appendix A of the book.

Almost completed. More elegant code will come soon.

TODO:
- Error handler in Yacc
- Operator precedence in Yacc
- Pointer problem
